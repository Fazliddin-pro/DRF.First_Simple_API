# DRF Selfedu - My First API Project with Django REST Framework

This is my first API project built using **Django REST Framework (DRF)**. It serves as a foundational step in mastering API development with Django.

## üåü Project Highlights:
- Implemented a **RESTful API** using DRF.
- Built **CRUD operations** for managing resources.
- Utilized **serializers & views** to structure API responses.
- Integrated **authentication & permissions** for secure access.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
- **Django & Django REST Framework**
- **Python** for backend logic
- **JWT authentication** for user security

This project is a work in progress, and I plan to enhance it with new features over time!
